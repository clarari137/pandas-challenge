# pandas-challenge
## PyCitySchools Sources
For this challenge, I followed the starter code provided and relied on class notes. 
I met with a tutor to discuss obtaining data as a series instead of a dataframe to complete the "School Summary" section. 
Danielle Dubash and I also met to discuss some bugs in terms of formatting the data and we talked through debugging the cell where I created my School Summary dataframe.
